# Jitsi 

### Audio, video and text messaging in real-time without additional software and services

Sometimes you need to discuss something with a family or colleagues. Urgent and as safe as possible. Unfortunately, your interlocutors are absolute newbies. They do not have suitable programs or no knowledge and skills. No motivation. No time for the briefing. Different devices: Windows, Mac, Android tablet, etc.

Jitsi Meet is an online chat using open source technology called WebRTC. It allows you to transfer video and audio data between browsers on a point-to-point basis, without a dedicated server. Jitsi Meet does not require the installation of programs or registration on any services. A normal browser is enough (Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome will do) or for mobile devices, you can use mobile applications. There are no restrictions on the number of chat participants. Text logs, audio and video recording of your chat are not kept or saved.
